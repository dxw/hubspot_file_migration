# Hubspot File Migration

Migrates files associated with deals from Pipeline Deals to Hubspot

## Usage

* Install dependencies by running `bundle install`
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the missing variables
* Run `bundle exec ruby run.rb`
* Wait and watch
* That's it!

## Notes

There's no tests, as this is pretty much a one shot thing. It's worked for us, but YMMV.
